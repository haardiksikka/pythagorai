# test-app

test-app is a comprehensive web application designed to showcase frontend and backend integration using modern development tools and frameworks. The app leverages a ReactJS-based frontend with a robust Express backend and MongoDB for data persistence. The application is designed to mock API calls during frontend development to ensure seamless integration testing.

## Overview

test-app is divided into two main parts - the frontend and the backend:

**Frontend**
- Built using ReactJS and Vite devserver, located in the `client/` folder.
- Uses the shadcn-ui component library with Tailwind CSS framework for styling.
- Implements client-side routing using `react-router-dom`, with page components located in `client/src/pages/` and other components in `client/src/components`.
- Runs on port 5173 and integrates with the backend via `/api/` prefix endpoints.
- Key implemented pages include the Home page (`/`).

**Backend**
- An Express-based server located in the `server/` folder.
- Implements REST API endpoints structured in the `api/` folder.
- Supports MongoDB with Mongoose for database operations.
- Runs on port 3000.

Both parts of the application can be started concurrently using a single command (`npm run start`), thanks to the configuration provided by the `concurrently` package.

## Features

- ReactJS frontend with Tailwind CSS styling.
- Shadcn-ui integrated component library.
- RESTful API using Express.js on the backend.
- MongoDB for data storage using Mongoose.
- Mock API responses for frontend development.
- Concurrently running frontend and backend with one command.

## Getting started

### Requirements
